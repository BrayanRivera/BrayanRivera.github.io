            <h2>About slippi.gg</h2>
            <p>Project Slippi is an ongoing project that aims to give Super Smash Bros. Melee several major quality of life features originally not present in the game. As of June 2020, the features currently included are automatically saved replays, live match mirroring, rollback netcode, and integrated online matchmaking. The project was created and is being led by <a class="rank-number" href="https://twitter.com/Fizzi36" target="_blank">Fizzi</a>. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most in-person tournament activity had been completely shut down since March 2020, and Project Slippi became the dominant method of playing Melee, with major tournament organizers hosting events using the new updates. Project Slippi has since been credited with bringing new players into the competitive Melee scene, due to its ease of access and ability to provide practice against anyone online.</p>
