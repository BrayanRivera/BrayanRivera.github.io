            <p>In this website, you will learn eveything there is to know about competitive Melee and why it's considered one of the best e-sports in the FGC (Fighting Game Community). The game was never meant to be played competitively by its creators at Nintento, but people started discovering techniques that allowed the player to move the characters in very creative and complicated ways. 21 years later after its release in November 2001, the game is still growing and pulling tens of thousands of viewers every major tournament.  </p>

        <p>Because of its 21 years of history, you'll be introduced to the top players that make the game stand out and the story lines that make each encounter between them so thrilling. From players that have been playing over 15 years, to players that started playing 5 years ago, these competitors pour their soul and time into the game and have to train hours everyday to keep their technique intact. Of course, all of this doesn't mean anything without tournaments! Which is why you'll be introduced to a series of tournaments that will happen in the next few months so you can take a peak at what this game is all about.</p>
