                <h2>How to L-Cancel!</h2>
                <p>L-canceling (an abbreviation of lag canceling) is a technique in Super Smash Bros. Melee that allows characters to act faster than usual when landing in the middle of an aerial attack. L-canceling is done by pressing the shield button 7 frames or fewer before landing in Melee.

                <h2>How to Wavedash!</h2>
                <p>A wavedash is a technique that is performed by air dodging diagonally into the ground, causing the character to slide a short distance. While it is uncommon in casual play, high-level play of Melee effectively requires proper use of the technique; the Melee community sees wavedashing as an advanced technique superior to dashing because it allows players to perform any ground action while moving horizontally on the ground.

                <h2>How to Dash Dance!</h2>
                <p>The dash-dance is an advanced technique in the Super Smash Bros. games. Performed by rapidly tapping the analog stick left and right while on the ground, it cancels out the character's initial dashing animation with another animation in the opposite direction, causing the character to quickly and repeatedly dash to the right and left in a short distance. By continuously switching directions, the player can confuse opponents in regards to their approach, as they can potentially either backtrack or approach while dash-dancing

                <h2>How to DI!</h2>
                <p>Directional influence (usually abbreviated DI) is the control the receiver of an attack has over their trajectory. Each attack sends its target in a particular direction; DI can be used to alter, but not completely change, this original trajectory. In Melee, DI is essential for escaping many combos. Effective DI allows players to survive up to higher damage percentages than usual.

                <h2>How to SHFFL!</h2>
                <p>The short hop fast fall L-cancel, commonly abbreviated as "SHFFL" (pronounced - and sometimes written - like the word "shuffle"), is a combination of advanced techniques that, for most characters, results in the quickest and least laggy way to jump and perform an aerial from the ground in Melee. SHFFLing is highly useful in battle and in competitive play because its speed allows players to use aerial attacks in tandem with ground moves.

                <h2>How to Edge Cancel!</h2>
                <p>Ledge-canceling (also known as edge canceling) is an advanced technique present in all games in the Super Smash Bros. series. It involves players sliding off a ledge (platform or stage ledge) either during landing lag or during a special move to cancel the animation. Ledge-canceling moves grants players opportunities for more movement options, making moves safer, and for granting followups in situations where a move normally would not have combo potential.

                <h2>How to Ledge Tech!</h2>
                <p>A wall tech is a technique usded against a wall when recovering. To wall tech, the player must press a shield button before hitting a wall while tumbling and the character must be in hitstun for it to work. Being able to consistently perform ledge techs dramatically increases a player's survivability.

                <h2>How to Meteor Cancel!</h2>
                <p>Meteor canceling is the act of instantly negating the downwards knockback of an attack that sends you down by jumping or using an up special after being hit. In Super Smash Bros. Melee, a meteor cancel can be done 8 frames after the hit lag ends, producing a distinctive wind-cutting sound and a sparkle (the character will also briefly glow white).
